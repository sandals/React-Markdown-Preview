Does this count as recursion?

React.js Markdown-Previewer is a simple component that pairs a "maximized" `<textarea>` with a `<div>` that contains Showdown.js markdown converted output. This is an exercise in React.js primarily for educational purposes. For something a little more usable check out my [React.js Blinking Rainbow component](https://github.com/sandals/React-Blinking-Rainbows).
